# CSCI 2041: Advanced Programming Principles (Spring 2025)

This repository contains my work for the Spring 2025 offering of **CSCI 2041** at the University of Minnesota, instructed by **Jack Kolb**.  
The course emphasizes principles and techniques for writing correct, robust, and modular programs, primarily using **OCaml**.

## Instructor
James Moen

## Language
OCaml (functional programming)

## Topics Covered

- Functional programming foundations
- Symbolic data and pattern matching
- Recursion and mathematical induction
- Immutable data structures and persistent state
- Evaluation strategies (eager vs lazy)
- Higher-order functions and closures
- Type-based program design
- Abstract data types and modules
- Search-based programming
- Parallel and concurrent computation

## Folder Structure

- `labs/`: Weekly lab exercises written in OCaml
- `projects/`: Larger assignments involving symbolic evaluation, interpreters, and modular design
- `notes/`: Lecture summaries and study notes
- `misc/`: Small experiments, utilities, and helper scripts
